# Overview

The `outcome` crate provides several augmentations of the `Result` type found
in the Rust standard library. It is *first and foremost* an experiment in
expressing more granular error handling contracts. It is secondly written for
library authors.

The current package name was generated via python 3's `uuid` module, by
calling `uuid5(uuid5(NAMESPACE_DNS, "occult.work"), "outcome")`

Detailed information on `outcome` can be found in the crate [documentation][1].
