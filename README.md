# Overview

The `outcome` crate provides several augmentations of the `Result` type found
in the Rust standard library. It is *first and foremost* an experiment in
expressing more granular error handling contracts. It is secondly written for
library authors.

Detailed information on `outcome` can be found in the crate [documentation][1].
